Возобновляемая энергетика

1. Ветряки

Смерти от ветряков. Люди и птицы.
In England, there were 163 wind turbine accidents that killed 14 people in 2011. Wind produced about 15 billion kWhrs that year, so using a capacity factor of 25%, that translates to about 1,000 deaths per trillion kWhrs produced (the world produces 15 trillion kWhrs per year from all sources).

These are pretty low numbers. By contrast, in 2011 coal produced about 180 billion kWhrs in England with about 3,000 related deaths. Nuclear energy produced over 90 billion kWhrs in England with no deaths. In that same year, America produced about 800 billion kWhrs from nuclear with no deaths.

2. Солнечная энергетика

Солнечные батареи на крышах стоят в два раза дороже чем в те, которые используются в фермах
Не могут служить постоянным источником энергии. 
Также нет прогресса в увеличении емкости батерей.
Постройка солнечных ферм требует очистки от дикой жизни.

Germany’s carbon emissions have been flat since 2009, 
despite an investment of $580 billion by 2025 in a renewables-heavy electrical grid, 
a 50 percent rise in electricity cost.

Meanwhile, France produces one-tenth the carbon emissions per 
unit of electricity as Germany and pays little more than half for its electricity. How? Through nuclear power.

Не все факторы учитываются при подсчете стоимости. Внедрение ВИЭ привело к увеличению стоимости электроэнергии в Германии/США. 

What about all the headlines about expensive nuclear and cheap solar and wind?
They are largely an illusion resulting from the fact that 70 to 80 percent
of the costs of building nuclear plants are up-front, whereas the 
costs given for solar and wind don’t include the high cost of transmission lines, new dams, or other forms of battery.

Because nuclear plants produce heat without fire, they emit no air pollution in the form of smoke. 

Thanks to its energy density, nuclear plants require far less land than renewables. Even in sunny California, 
a solar farm requires 450 times more land to produce the same amount of energy as a nuclear plant.

All of the waste fuel from 45 years of the Swiss nuclear program can fit, in canisters, on a basketball court-like warehouse, 
where like all spent nuclear fuel, it has never hurt a fly.
As a nuclear-trained engineer no longer working in the industry, I can attest that the majority of nuclear plant construction costs (and operating costs) are regulatory-driven. None of these regulations improve safety, but have been imposed through the years as a sacrifice to the anti-nuclear activists. Smarter regulation (i.e., constructive not punitive) would dramatically bring down the cost of building and operating the next generation nuclear plants.
As a side note, nuclear waste is a problem in the US but not France or Switzerland because Jimmy Carter banned the reprocessing of spent fuel. This increases the volume of waste by orders of magnitude

Desserts are not good locations for solar farms. 
Too much dust, which has to be cleaned from the panels on a regular basis, which requires lots of water and energy.
